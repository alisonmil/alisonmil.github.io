            <h1>About This Site:</h1>
            <p>(And the story behind it)</p>


<p>UnI is an interactive story website that tells the story of a futuristic world with invasive technology which can both help you and hurt you.</p>
<p>Our story begins with a young woman who is bored, using the internet to procrastinate. With the suggestion of a Facebook ad, she signs up for a site that purports to entertain you by telling the perfect story for you. Interestingly, this site is made by the same people that run UnI.</p>
<p>Through the eyes of the site itself, we see the love story of a couple who find each other with UnI. As the story continues, we realize that the cute fictional story is actually the true story of a real life couple. Slowly, readers and the main character discover the truth behind the technology.</p>
<p>The site gets more insistent and more invasive- and you'll have to find out what happens next when the story goes live!</p>
            <p></p>

            <p> This website contains information about the UnI site, which will exist within the universe of the story being told. The videos that were created for this project, as well as the audio and the site, might be used as little easter eggs in the final story. Currently, the site serves as a method of sparking interest and compiling the existing media for the site.</p>
